        <p>The <i>Shaded Maps</i> project, born by chance during the COVID pandemic
        on an island in the Mediterranean Sea, is the brainchild of a
        research software engineer with a passion for maps.
        This project involves creating a collection of images that represent shadows
        on each pixel of a map, caused by obstructions between the pixel and various
        positions of the sun in the sky.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Obstructions are depicted using high-resolution digital surface models,
        which are sometimes already available through national, regional, or city geoportals,
        or otherwise generated from open data LiDAR point clouds.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Creating a single shaded map requires:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>an extensive and detailed digital surface model;</li>
            <li>the identification of areas covered by water (e.g., ocean, sea,
            lakes, rivers, canals);</li>
            <li>the computationally expensive calculation of shadows for each pixel
            and for 250+ sun positions;</li>
            <li>the transformation of the calculated shadows into images.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <p>Morever, many other difficulties challenges are tackled:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>finding the necessary data, which is often difficult as it may not exist,
            or the geoportal is complicated to navigate <i>by design</i> or because
            of language barrier;</li>
            <li>ensuring the data is of high quality (resolution should not exceed one meter)
            and available for a sufficiently large area (at least 10 km x 10 km);</li>
            <li>building the digital surface model from raster files, if available,
            or after the processing of LiDAR point cloud files;</li>
            <li>archiving and managing 15+ TB of raw data, processed data, metadata and images;</li>
            <li>publishing the shaded maps on the web, which is not so straightforward
            when the images are huge.</li>
        </ul>
